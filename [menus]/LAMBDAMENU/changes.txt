Final Project Update [3/13/2017]

Project has been rebranded as Lambda Menu

--Fixed ** INVALID ** player name issue
--Removed fire ammo & explosive ammo/melee
--All hotkeys can be disabled with NULL (lm-config.xml)
--Added GTA:O style pointing when pressing "B" key (lm-config.xml)
--Added player death blip

----(Code contributed by thedroidgeek)

Previous Releases As Enhanced Reborn

Update 5 [1/28/2017]

ACTIONS:
--Added 3 'clear task' options

VEHICLES:
-Added proper removal/delete
-Added proper door locking

OTHER:
--Added clip recording (er-config.xml)
----F3 key to start recording / stop recording with save
----DEL key to discard current recording (must be recording to discard)

CLIP EDITING:
To edit the clips you recorded, you MUST remain connected to the server. This ensures the loading of custom
resources from the server, in the editor. The process to edit clips goes like this (for now):
1: Record and save your clip
2: In the trainer, select "Leave Session"
3: Pause and select the Rockstar Editor
4: Edit/Save/Export your clips as normal
5: Exit game when finished

Note: If you completely disconnect from the server you recorded the clips on, rather than 'leave session',
you will not be able to see any of the custom server resources (this means all custom cars, guns, maps, etc).
Currently this is the only way to edit videos and there is no way to rejoin the server from the closed session,
or from video editing. Hopefully this process will become more streamlined in the future.
