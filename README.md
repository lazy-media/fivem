# FiveM Server Setup
FiveM Server Setup. QB-Core Version. Comes with modded vehicles, map mods, everything you need.

# Resources

All Mods were found and downloaded from [GTA5 Mods](https://gta5-mods.com)

Any vehicles in the `[vehicles]/[vehicle_pack]` were from [here](https://github.com/five-m/Vehicles/tree/master)

I take no credit in creating any of these. I simply just gathered all the resources necessary to run a FiveM server and put it all in one place.
